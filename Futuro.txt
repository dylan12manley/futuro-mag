march 2nd 2020 - from Joey P

Sorry this has taken me so long but letsI had to just kind of throw this together but lets see what happens.

Attached is a basic wire frame of site in it's bare bones man , I don;t exactly know what your going to use on the back-end of the site to allow me and admins and contributors to be able to edit post and easily change advertising modules without hitting you up all the time but I will let you trouble shoot that.

So  was thinking an a cool Futuro kind of digital graphic enter page with music would be sick like this https://basement.studio/.
Once you enter it takes you to the home page which is laid out in subsequent order.
.1. Top Nav , Futuro Logo with section ,
large image gallery like on Oytermagazine. pretty same thing should be easy as pie.

2. Secondary Image modules , Id like to have an area where featured articles go , and subsequent featured articles follow.

3 . Static articles scroll downward in a linear form just like of the exsisting futuro magazine.

4. Advertsinsg modules scroll down the side.

That's it man , its pretty much the same thing , just and enter page thats dope , and changed top nave and secondary image gallery.
